# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based fake news detection system built with Python. It classifies news articles as **real** or **fake** based on their content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## 🔍 Features
- TF-IDF vectorization for text preprocessing
- Passive Aggressive Classifier for fast and accurate text classification
- Achieves ~94% accuracy on test data
- Trained on a dataset of 20,000 news articles (real and fake)

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- TF-IDF (from sklearn.feature_extraction.text)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integrate Flask or Streamlit for web-based predictions
- Experiment with deep learning models like BERT
- Add title + author + metadata as features

## 📁 Dataset
Used a labeled dataset of news articles with `text` and `label` (`real`/`fake`).

## 💡 Key Learning
This project strengthened my understanding of NLP pipelines, vectorization techniques, and model evaluation for binary classification problems.
